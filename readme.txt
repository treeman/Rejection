My game for the experimental gameplay project february theme: Rejection

Puh.. It's been a really really long road for this one. It was made in 7 days between 22/2 to 28/2 in about 25 hours work + 15 hours break. 

Well it's Valentine's Day and as the geek you are this is the worst day ever. Luckily you havean almost complete time machine hidden here in the grass and if you could complete it you'll be safe for now! But beware... The girls are searching for you! Place traps and run away!

Steer with arrow keys and actions with space.
